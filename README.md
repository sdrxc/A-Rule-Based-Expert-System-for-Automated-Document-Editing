##  Abstract

This book chapter presents a **rule-based expert system** designed to automate document editing tasks. Leveraging linguistic and syntactic rules, the system aids in refining document qualityâ€”correcting grammar, standardizing formatting, and ensuring clarity. We describe system architecture, rule hierarchy, and inference mechanisms using real-world text-editing examples from academic and technical documents.
